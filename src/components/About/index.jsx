            I want to think <strong>big</strong> and outside the box when
            building my sites and applications. In todays world of development
            providing an intuitive, unique experience for the user, while
            maintaining accessibility and scalability standards, can be the key
            to jumpstarting your site to the highest realms of the interwebs.

              Web sites that have features of mobile applications like offline
              capabilities, push notifications, responsiveness, and even the
              ability to download the site to your phones home screen might
              possibly be the future of the web. This website hits a 95 PWA
              rating. But it still has that annoying loading wheel at the
              beginning ..

              With the emergence of React Native, web developers can not only
              build your website, but also build a fully featured mobile
              application for both Android and iOS devices, for a quarter of the
              cost.

              Using Amazon Web Services, and various other technologies like
              Heroku and Microsoft Azure, I can handle the deployment and
              hosting needed for the site.
